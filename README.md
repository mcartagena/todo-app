This app helps to learn basic concepts of redux, it uses es6, react and redux.  Based on the course of Digital : ReactJS.

Create a React and Redux Todo List app. All you need to focus are Actions, Reducers, Containers, Store and Components.

-A ToDo application would typically allow you to perform actions like:

    --Adding a task
    --Marking a task as complete
    --Filtering tasks

-In our ToDo App, we would want to store:

    --Actual List of ToDo's
    --Current Visibility Filter

-Reducers to handle the actions.
